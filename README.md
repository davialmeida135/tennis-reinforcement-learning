In other words: Attribution is required. Non-commercial use only.

I'm serious about the license, and I'm really disappointed with the handful of people who have chosen to violate it. If violations continue, I may stop updating the repo entirely. If you're going to use something that has required thousands of person-hours to build and maintain, it seems to reasonable to require that you understand and follow a simple license.
